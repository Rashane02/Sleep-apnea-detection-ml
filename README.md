# Sleep-apnea-detection-ml
Ongoing project to develop a wearable device which can detect OSA and measure sleep quality


This project showcases a smart, wearable device powered by machine learning to detect sleep apnea in real-time. Using non-invasive biosignals like 📉 SpO₂ desaturation and 🌀 body motion, the system monitors breathing patterns overnight and identifies apnea events with high accuracy. Designed to be 🛌 home-friendly, 💰 affordable, and ⚙️ easy to use and accessible.
